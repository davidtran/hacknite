# Ruby Vietnam Hackight

Hack9 is a special event that we organise every 2 month. The length of the event is 3hrs.

The format is variable and could be one or many of following activities:

* Solve kata (or coding exercise)
* Hack on new projects
* Discussion

Members are welcome to join and we will be hacking on ideas that we have proposed and voted in our repository issue page.

If you want to submit a proposal, please create a new issue ticket and let everybody know in the chat room
